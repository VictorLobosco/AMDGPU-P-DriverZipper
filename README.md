# AMDGPU-P-DriverZipper

A simple script that gathers and zips all the files used by a AMD GPU driver install so it can be used in a hyper-v virtual machine.                                                                                                                                         

# How it works

Just run it and it will create an zip with the files you need, then just copy it to the virtual machine and extract the files on the C: drive.
